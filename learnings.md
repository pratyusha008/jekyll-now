Music is an ocean and it's a life time deal. There will be a lot left to learn even if one is an eminent musician with more than 50 years of practice and expertise. Therefore though SruthiRanjani doesnot believe in fitting Music into a curriculum or framework,it believes in the traditional and appropriate approach framed by profound Musicians towards understanding basics and getting better through various techniques of music.

For a person who wants to start music afresh,
<ul>
	<li>Saraliswaras</li>
	<li>Jantaswaras</li>
	<li>Daatu swaras</li>
	<li>Hechhu sthayi swaras</li>
	<li>Alankaras</li>
</ul>

in Raga MAYAMALAVAGOWLA along with few easy bhajans are taught through which the student can understand the concept of Sruthi(Pitch), Talam(Rhythm) both practically and theoritically.
SruthiRanjani makes sure that the student is well equipped with all the notes for the same.

For a person who already has understanding of the above said basics,
<ul>
	<li>Geethams</li>
	<li>Swarapallavis</li>
	<li>Swarajathis</li>
</ul>

in various ragas and rythm patterns along with few simple keerthans/krithis are taught that not only brings betterment in the understanding of Sruthi and laya but also makes the student understand the concept of ragas and their characteristics.
SruthiRanjani gives a detailed notes and explanation for the same.

For a person whom we believe to be strong in the above said levels after standard scrutiny by our teachers,
<ul>
	<li>Varnam</li>
	<li>Krithis</li>
	<li>Padam</li>
	<li>Javali</li>
	<li>Jathis are taught along with practice techniques that inculcates creativity(Manodharmam) and prepares the student to sing in concerts/perform on stages.</li>
</ul>

As this is a very crucial stage of learning music, SruthiRanjani assures the student with best practice guidelines.
Also, by the end of this level, the student will have a clear practical and theoretical idea of Saptaswaras, Sruthi, 35 talas, swarasthanas, characteristics of various ragas and gets the ability to sing in 3 speeds and also the ability to sing the basics in different ragas.

Also SruthiRanjani makes sure that our duty to know the history of music and the profound and eminent Indian musicians(vaggeyakaras), is fulfilled.

Apart from the above, for a person who wants to quench his thirst of singing easy, famous and divine compositions, learning Semi-classical music is the right choice. Depending on the sruthi-laya understanding of the person, those compositions which suits his voice and knowledge are taught to him.
